# Design Patterns Learning Journey

## Overview
Working through the classic design patterns from the "Gang of Four" book *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* (1994).

## Learning Approach
Each pattern is learned through hands-on practice:
1. Request an assignment from Claude with clear requirements
2. Implement the solution using the appropriate design pattern
3. Validate understanding through working code

The patterns are tackled in order of increasing complexity, from foundational concepts to more advanced architectural patterns.

## Pattern Projects

### 2. **Factory Method** - Document Export System

### 3. **Strategy** - Payment Processing System
*Implementing interchangeable payment methods with runtime selection*

### 4. **Observer** - Weather Monitoring Station
*Building auto-updating displays that respond to weather data changes*

### 5. **Decorator** - Coffee Shop Beverage System
